<h1> Mwin </h1>
  <p>Mwin is a tool that lets the user arrange his/her programs in a way that makes multitasking easier: sometimes one needs several windows open at once, but with limited display-space, ALT+TAB'ing between multiple windows can get tedious very quickly. 
  
  Mwin is here to help you quickly select and resize all of your windows to make them fit onto one screen. Using the Tkinter library to create a simple user interface, Mwin is easy to configure and deploy.
